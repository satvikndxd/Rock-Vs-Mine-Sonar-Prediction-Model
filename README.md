# Rock-Vs-Mine-Sonar-Prediction-Model
SONAR Object Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify objects detected by SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology into two categories: rocks and mines. It utilizes a machine learning approach, specifically logistic regression, to predict the classification of the detected objects based on the features extracted from SONAR data.

Instructions
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Dataset: Place the SONAR dataset (sonar data.csv) in the same directory as the source code file.
Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries mentioned in the source code (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
Run the Code: Execute the source code in a Python environment. Ensure that the paths are correctly set for loading the dataset.
Input Data: Optionally, you can modify the input_data variable with your own SONAR data for prediction.
View Prediction: The program will output the prediction result, indicating whether the detected object is a rock or a mine.
